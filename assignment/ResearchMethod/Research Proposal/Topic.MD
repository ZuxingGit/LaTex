## Terrain Perception Using Wearable Parrot-Inspired Companion Robot, KiliRo
Research indicates that deaths due to fall incidents are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths in the world. Death by fall due to a person texting or talking on mobile phones while walking, impaired vision, unexpected terrain changes, low balance, weakness, and chronic conditions has increased drastically over the past few decades.
A solution for such a warning system used in our bio-inspired wearable pet robot, KiliRo. It is a terrain perception system used to classify the terrain based on visual features obtained from processing the images captured by a camera and notify the wearer of terrain changes while walking. The parrot-inspired KiliRo robot can twist its head and the camera up to 180 degrees to obtain visual feedback for classification. The results indicate an accuracy of over 95% across five terrain types, namely pedestrian pathways, road, grass, interior, and staircase.

## Exploring behaviours perceived as important for human—Dog bonding and their translation to a robotic platform
More evidence shows modelling robots on social animals is useful to facilitate long-term engagement with social robots.
Thematic analysis identified 7 categories of behaviours perceived as important to human—dog bonding, including: 1) attunement, 2) communication, 3) consistency and predictability, 4) physical affection, 5) positivity and enthusiasm, 6) proximity, and 7) shared activities.
providing insight into important behaviours for human—dog bonding, this work provides a springboard for those hoping to implement dog behaviours into animal-like artificial agents designed for social roles.

Dogs behaviors are intelligent and intentional. Researchers are concerning that by creating the illusion of intelligence or intentionality can make people feel being deceived by technology. When designing behaviours for a robotic dog, it will be necessary to consider such issues, weigh up the benefits and risks of robot deception, involve researchers from a broad range of disciplines to contribute to design and regulation (including law, ethics, social sciences, developmental psychology, etc).
serve as long-term social companions for those individuals who are unable to look after a live pet for whatever reason.


## “That’s Something for Children”: An Ethnographic Study of Attitudes and Practices of Care Attendants and Nursing Home Residents Towards Robotic Pets
With increasing numbers of care recipients and a decreasing number of trained caregivers, robotic systems are increasingly seen as possible technical aids against the background of demographic change and the associated pressures on care systems.
A simple way of usage is an advantage. The appearance of the cat and dog is appropriate and is something that could be integrated into the daily care routine.
spending time with robotic pets makes the residents feel relaxed.
react to touch
make animal-like sounds when the sensors detect tactile touch or light. When touch the back or back of the head, a purring sound (cat) or barking (dog) and movement sound is triggered. 
The cat and dog can move their heads, eyes, and mouths.


## Digital Twins of Pet Robots to Prolong Interdependent Relationships and Effects on Student Learning Performance
The use of robots in education has the potential to engage students in learning activities and aims to form lasting relationships with them.
Digital twin technology facilitates ubiquitous engagement with pet robots, thereby prolonging interdependent through a SeamlessPet robot learning approach. Virtual and physical pet robots enables realistic and continuous interactions. Ensured consistent availability and authentic interactions, enhancing educational outcomes.
fostering prolonged learning participation, empowering students to take ownership of their learning, stay motivated, and feel supported at any time and from anywhere in the learning process.

## The Holistic Expression Factors of Emotional Motion for Non-humanoid Robots
Non-humanoid robots, such as robotic sweepers and mechanical pets have potential function of emotional support for individuals. Current existing non-humanoid robots are task-oriented and lack features such as facial expressions and sound.
The results indicate that both vertical and horizontal movements can convey emotional valence. However, if both of them exist, there is no leading direction to the valence recognition result.
When both vertical and horizontal movements are present, valence recognition is influenced by the combined effects of stimulation, vertical repetition, and movement direction.
Non-humanoid robots can display recognizable emotional content when influenced by holistic expression factors.
In Gestalt theory, holistic factors include **similar appearance (similarity principle), potential contours (closure principle), continuation (continuity principle), proximity (proximity principle), and direction (common fate principle)** et al.

## Towards emotionally aligned social robots for dementia: perspectives of care partners and persons with dementia
Socially assistive robots, embodied character or pets that provide companionship and aid through social interaction, are a promising tool to support people with dementia.
Strong emotional alignment between users and robots will be necessary for social robots to provide meaningful companionship.

## “A Safe Space for Sharing Feelings”: Perspectives of Children with Lived Experiences of Anxiety on Social Robots
Social robots have the potential to support health and quality of life for children experiencing anxiety.

Participants desired a pet-like robot with a soft texture, expressive eyes, and emotion detection to support activities of daily living.
Emotional alignment between the robot and users can have a positive effect on their mood most of the time.

Social robots should be developed in collaboration with end users to ensure that devices are well suited to their needs and priorities.

## Friends from the Future: A Scoping Review of Research into Robots and Computer Agents to Combat Loneliness in Older People
Loneliness is a common problem in older adults and contribute to poor health.

The scoping review shows the intervention helped to mitigate loneliness by acting as a direct companion, a catalyst for social interaction, facilitating remote communication with others and reminding users of upcoming social engagements.
