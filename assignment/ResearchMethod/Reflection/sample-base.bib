  abstract  = {The revolution of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, and its implications for human–robot interaction (HRI) opened up the debate on crucial regulatory, business, societal, and ethical considerations. This paper explores essential issues from the anthropomorphic perspective, examining the complex interplay between humans and AI models in societal and corporate contexts. We provided a comprehensive review of existing literature on HRI, with a special emphasis on the impact of generative models such as ChatGPT. The scientometric study posits that due to their advanced linguistic capabilities and ability to mimic human-like behavior, generative AIs like ChatGPT will continue to grow in popularity in pair with human rational empathy, tendency for personification and their advanced linguistic capabilities and ability to mimic human-like behavior. As they blur the boundaries between humans and robots, these models introduce fresh moral and philosophical dilemmas. Our research aims to extrapolate key trends and unique factors in HRI and to elucidate the technical aspects of generative AI that enhance its effectiveness in this field compared to traditional rule-based AI systems. We further discuss the challenges and limitations of applying generative AI in HRI, providing a future research agenda for AI optimization in diverse applications, including education, entertainment, and healthcare.},

@article{AkpanIkpeJustice2025Caga,
  abstract  = {Artificial intelligence (AI) as a disruptive technology is not new. However, its recent evolution, engineered by technological transformation, big data analytics, and quantum computing, produces conversational and generative AI (CGAI/GenAI) and human‐like chatbots that disrupt conventional operations and methods in different fields. This study investigates the scientific landscape of CGAI and human–chatbot interaction/collaboration and evaluates use cases, benefits, challenges, and policy implications for multidisciplinary education and allied industry operations. The publications trend showed that just 4% (n = 75) occurred during 2006–2018, while 2019–2023 experienced astronomical growth (n = 1763 or 96%). The prominent use cases of CGAI (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching, learning, and research activities occurred in computer science (multidisciplinary and AI; 32%), medical/healthcare (17%), engineering (7%), and business fields (6%). The intellectual structure shows strong collaboration among eminent multidisciplinary sources in business, information systems, and other areas. The thematic structure highlights prominent CGAI use cases, including improved user experience in human–computer interaction, computer programs/code generation, and systems creation. Widespread CGAI usefulness for teachers, researchers, and learners includes syllabi/course content generation, testing aids, and academic writing. The concerns about abuse and misuse (plagiarism, academic integrity, privacy violations) and issues about misinformation, danger of self‐diagnoses, and patient privacy in medical/healthcare applications are prominent. Formulating strategies and policies to address potential CGAI challenges in teaching/learning and practice are priorities. Developing discipline‐based automatic detection of GenAI contents to check abuse is proposed. In operational/operations research areas, proper CGAI/GenAI integration with modeling and decision support systems requires further studies.},

@article{CamposRicardo2020YKef,
  abstract  = {As the amount of generated information grows, reading and summarizing texts of large collections turns into a challenging task. Many documents do not come with descriptive terms, thus requiring humans to generate keywords on-the-fly. The need to automate this kind of task demands the development of keyword extraction systems with the ability to automatically identify keywords within the text. One approach is to resort to machine-learning algorithms. These, however, depend on large annotated text corpora, which are not always available. An alternative solution is to consider an unsupervised approach. In this article, we describe YAKE!, a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on statistical text features extracted from single documents to select the most relevant keywords of a text. Our system does not need to be trained on a particular set of documents, nor does it depend on dictionaries, external corpora, text size, language, or domain. To demonstrate the merits and significance of YAKE!, we compare it against ten state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and one supervised method. Experimental results carried out on top of twenty datasets show that YAKE! significantly outperforms other unsupervised methods on texts of different sizes, languages, and domains.},

@article{GaoXiaofeng2023CEPA,
  abstract  = {Nowadays, the primary media for information dissemination is shifting to online platforms. Events usually burst online through multiple modern online media. Therefore, predicting event popularity trends becomes crucial for online platforms to track public concerns and make appropriate decisions. However, little research focuses on event popularity prediction from a cross platform perspective. Challenges stem from the vast diversity of events and media, limited access to aligned datasets across different platforms, and a considerable amount of noise in datasets. In this paper, we solve the cross-platform event popularity prediction problem by proposing a model named DancingLines , which is mainly composed of three parts. First, we propose TF-SW , a semantic-aware popularity quantification model based on Term Frequency with Semantic Weight. TF-SW obtains the event popularity based on Word2Vec and TextRank, and generates Event Popularity Time Series (EPTS). Then, we propose <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">\omega</tex-math> <mml:math><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="gao-ieq1-3090663.gif"/> </inline-formula> DTW-CD , a pairwise time series alignment model derived from Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) with Compound Distance (CD) for aligning the EPTS on several platforms. Finally, we aggregate two time series and propose a neural-based prediction model implementing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention mechanism to obtain accurate event popularity predictions. Evaluation results based on large scale real-world datasets demonstrate that DancingLines can efficiently characterize, align, and predict event popularity in a cross-platform manner.},
